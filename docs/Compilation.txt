Part A: Preparing the Visual Studio environment

 Visual Studio 2013
  1. Install Visual C++ 2013, part of Visual Studio 2013 Professional (Express won't work, other editions work fine)
  2. Make sure you install all available updates from Microsoft Update
  3. Install the DirectX SDK (June 2010) -> http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71193

 Visual Studio 2015
  1. Install Visual C++ 2015, part of Visual Studio 2015 (any edition will work fine)
  2. Make sure you install all available updates from Microsoft Update
  3. Install the DirectX SDK (June 2010) -> http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71193


Part B: Preparing the GCC environment
 NOTES:
  * If you installed the MSYS/MinGW package in an other directory you will have to use that path in the following steps.
  * If you don't have Git installed then the revision number will be a hard-coded one, like 1.6.3.0.

 1. Download MSYS2
    32-bit: http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/i686/
    64-bit: http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/ (Recommended)
 2. Install or extract it to "C:\MSYS"
 3. Run msys2_shell.bat (if you did not use an installer you must restart MSYS2 after first run)
 4. Install needed software by running those commands:
    update-core
    pacman -Su
    pacman -S make pkg-config diffutils git
    Note that this is bare minimum, you can install more packages that can be of use to you
 5. Download YASM and save as "yasm.exe" in "C:\MSYS\usr\bin"
    32-bit: http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/releases/yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe
    64-bit: http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/releases/yasm-1.3.0-win64.exe (Recommended)
 6. Download and extract mingw to "C:\MSYS\mingw" http://files.1f0.de/mingw/
    (you might use MSYS2 package, but we recomend this one)
 7. Create a file named "build.user.bat" in "C:\mpc-hc" containing the following entries, adapted for your system:

@ECHO OFF
SET "MSYSTEM=MINGW32"
SET "MPCHC_MSYS=C:\MSYS"
SET "MPCHC_MINGW32=%MPCHC_MSYS%\mingw"
SET "MPCHC_MINGW64=%MPCHC_MINGW32%"
REM Git is optional to set if you chose to add it in PATH when installing it
REM It will be automatically detected if installed through pacman
SET "MPCHC_GIT=C:\Program Files\Git"
REM Optional, if you plan to modify the translations, install Python 2.7 or set the variable to its path
SET "MPCHC_PYTHON=C:\Python27"


Part C: Downloading and compiling the MPC-HC source

1. Use Git to clone MPC-HC's repository to "C:\mpc-hc" (or anywhere else you like)
    Download Git from https://git-for-windows.github.io/
    Run:
      git clone --recursive https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc.git

      or

      git clone https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc.git
      git submodule update --init --recursive

    If a submodule update fails, try running:
      git submodule foreach --recursive git fetch --tags
    then run the update again
      git submodule update --init --recursive

    Note that you can add `-b master` to the `git clone` command if you want to get the latest stable version
    instead of the latest development version
2. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpc-hc.sln"
    Change the solution's configuration to "Release" (in the toolbar).
3. Press F7 to build the solution.
4. You now have "mpc-hc.exe" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86"
5. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpciconlib.sln"
6. Press F7 to build the solution.
7. You now have "mpciconlib.dll" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86"
8. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpcresources.sln"
7. Build "BuildAll" project
9. You now have "mpcresources.XX.dll" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86\Lang"

Alternatively, you can use "build.bat" that can build everything for you
(run: build.bat help for more info)


Part D: Building the installer

Download Inno Setup Unicode v5.5.6 or newer from: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Install everything and then go to "C:\mpc-hc\distrib", open "mpc-hc_setup.iss" with Inno Setup,
read the first comments in the script and compile it.
Notes:
* "build.bat" can build the installer by using the "installer" or the "packages" switch.
* Use Inno Setup's built-in IDE if you want to edit the iss file.
